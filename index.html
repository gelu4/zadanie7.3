  		<div class="first-row">
  			<p>Though we've had our troubles now and then
Now is the time to make them up again
Sure aren't we all Irish anyhow
Now is the time to step together now
</p>
  		</div>	
  		<div class="second-row">
  			<p>Tinker, tailor, every mother's son
Butcher, baker shouldering his gun
Rich man, poor man, every man in line
All together just like Old Land Syne
</p>
  		</div>
  		<div class="third-row">
  			<p>Night is darkest just before the dawn
From dissention Ireland is reborn
Soon we'll all be United Irishmen
Make our land a Nation Once Again</p>
